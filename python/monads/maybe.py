def lift(fn):
    """Lift a function into a Maybe monad.

    Converts a plain function to one that can accept Maybe arguments
    (positional or keyword) and returns a Maybe value.

    The returned function returns Nothing if any of the arguments are
    Nothing. Otherwise, it returns Just(<return value of original function>).

    The converted function accepts both Maybe (with are unpacked) and non-Maybe
    arguments (with are used as-is).

    Examples:

    >>> maybe_abs = lift(abs)
    >>> maybe_abs(Just(-1))
    Just(1)
    >>> maybe_abs(Nothing)
    Nothing
    >>> maybe_abs(0)

class Maybe(object):
    """Maybe monad.

    Wraps a value (or nonexistence of the value) inside an opaque container.
    The container can be used in place of the actual value in all operations
    (including mathematical and logical operations, attribute access, and
    function calls).

    The monad is either `Nothing` (a singleton object like None, signalling the
    nonexistence of any value) or `Just(value)` (a wrapper around the actual
    value).

    All operations on the monad are short-circuited to return `Nothing` if the
    monad is `Nothing`, and to perform the operation on the actual value if the
    monad is `Just(value)`. This allows for easy chaining of operations on a
    value without checking for result existence or validity after each step.

    `Nothing` is a singleton and different from any `Just` value:

    >>> Nothing is (Nothing + Nothing)
    True
    >>> Nothing is Just(None)
    False

    Math/logical operators work as expected:

    >>> assert (Nothing == 1) is Nothing
    >>> assert Nothing + Just(1) is Nothing
    >>> assert Nothing - 1 is Nothing
    >>> assert 2 * Nothing is Nothing
    >>> assert Just(2) / Nothing is Nothing
    >>> assert Just(10) % 3 == Just(1)
    >>> assert Just(5) > 3
    >>> assert Just(5) == 5
    >>> assert Just(5) < 6
    >>> assert Just(5) != 6

    Note that `Nothing` in boolean context is always False (for easier checking
    without explicit cast to `bool`), while `Just` is False or True depending
    on its value:

    >>> bool(Nothing)
    False
    >>> bool(Just(1))
    True
    >>> bool(Just(0))
    False

    Accessing attributes on `Maybe` either short-cuts to `Nothing` or accesses
    the corresponding attributes in the contained value:

    >>> assert Nothing.foo is Nothing
    >>> assert Just('hello').upper() >> str == 'HELLO'

    `Maybe` is a callable and will either short-curcuit for `Nothing`, or call
    the contained value:

    >>> assert Nothing() is Nothing
    >>> assert Just(lambda: 42)() >> int == 42

    The above two facts, combined, mean that we can do something like:

    >>> Just("hello world").upper()
    Just('HELLO WORLD')

    Right-shift operator (>>) can be used in the same way as monadic bind in
    Haskell (>>=):

    >>> Just(5) >> (lambda x: Just(x * 2))
    Just(10)

    In Python, this is useful for getting the value back from the Monad, and at
    the same time verifying that it can be cast to a specific type:

    >>> Just(5) >> int
    5
    >>> Just('hello') >> int
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'

    Often it is useful to get either the actual value (if any) or a default
    value in the case of `Nothing`. Although this can be done with `>>`,
    there's a nicer and shorter syntax for it using the bitwise or operator
    (`|`):

    >>> Just(5) | 0
    5
    >>> Nothing | 0
    0

    When cast to string or unicode, `Nothing` will evaluate to an empty string,
    and `Just` will call the to-string conversion methods of the contained
    value:

    >>> str(Nothing)
    ''
    >>> unicode(Nothing)
    u''

    And finally, here's proof `Maybe` really is a monad (the required axioms
    hold):

    >>> assert (Just(42) >> int) == 42  # (return x) >>= f <=> f x
    >>> assert (Just('hello') >> str) == 'hello'  # (return x >>= f <=> f x)
    >>> assert (Just(42) >> Just) == Just(42)  # m >>= return <=> m
    >>> assert (Just('hello') >> Just) == Just('hello')  # m >>= return <=> m
    >>> # (m >>= f) >>= g <=> m >>= (lambda x -> (f x >>= g))
    >>> assert ((Just(-1) >> (lambda x: Just(abs(x))) >> str) ==
    ... Just(-1) >> (lambda x: str(abs(x))) == '1')
