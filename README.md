# Monads

This repository started because I read Senko Rasic's article
[Maybe in Python][], a great look at how the maybe monad can clean up typical
Python code. I wanted to try it myself. So I copied it here.

Like Senko and [Tom Stuart][Refactoring Ruby with Monads], I believe that
monads are useful abstractions. They provide a way to write better, safer,
easier to understand code. And they're not limited to Haskell.

So I hope to expand this repository with useful examples of monads implemented
in common programming languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. If you're
reading this, I hope you find this interesting too.
